# Time Explorer
Time Explorer is an interactive art installation that utilises user generated content strategy to enable users read a historical message delivered from the past or to deliver a message to a specific time and date in the future through the Time Explorer website

The system is consisting of four major components:
▪ Processing Sketch

▪ Front end HTML

▪ Back end

▪ Database

There will be a combination of maximum 4 letters and postcards displayed on the wall in a moderately fast falling motion. Kinect will be able to accurately detect when an audience is in the interactive area and a little coloured hand icon will be displayed on the wall as a metaphor to notify user. The audience can use left, right, or both hand to wave and open a letter, and hold read the letter. The letter will be closed when Kinect detected the audience has left. Additionally, an iPad will be provided on a desk for users to access the Time Explorer website and to write and deliver a message to the future.
